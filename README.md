# ConfyMate

This aims to be an Elixir based PoC (for now) to help out with the workflows while organizing a conference. It manages all aspects of conference management starting with initial discussions, calendar management, registration process, topic/speaker selection process, collaborations, checklists/follow-ups, mass mailing/notifications, and integration with external systems.

If you manage your events through Meetup/EventBrite, this app helps you to do all the "meta" work before you place it on those apps.
